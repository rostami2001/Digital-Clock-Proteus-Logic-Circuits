# Digital-Clock-Proteus-Logic-Circuits

## Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a digital clock using Proteus simulation software, created as a final project for Logic Circuits course in Spring 2022.

## Key Features
- Fully functional digital clock (HH:MM:SS)
- Implemented using basic logic gates and sub-circuits
- Proper labeling and hierarchical design
- Starts counting from 00:00:00

## Technical Details
- **Software**: Proteus 8 Professional
- **Design Methodology**:
  - Used 7-segment displays for output
  - Implemented counter circuits
  - Designed clock divider for 1Hz signal
- **Project Type**: Individual academic project

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Digital_Clock_Project.pdsprj` in Proteus
3. Run the simulation (click the play button)
4. Observe the clock counting from 00:00:00

## Academic Note
This project represents one of my early experiences with circuit simulation software.
